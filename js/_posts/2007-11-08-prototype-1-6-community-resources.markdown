Most of you already know that [we released Prototype 1.6 final][1] yesterday. But there is more: Christophe Porteneuve from Prototype Core team has published [a book the very same day that covers all the new features in Prototype 1.6 and script.aculo.us 1.8][2]; Kangax, a very active community member, has released [scripteka.com–Prototype Extensions Library][3]; and Andrew Dupont blogged about a real-world example for new custom events system—[capturing the mouse wheel][4]. Kangax also wrote about [using custom events to detect user’s idle state][5].

Rails 2.0 now also includes Prototype 1.6 and script.aculo.us 1.8. If you are running on trunk, be sure to use the rake task to update javascripts when you’re ready to upgrade. Check out the Prototype library release notes for a list of API changes, but rest assured—it’s backward-compatible for the most part.
