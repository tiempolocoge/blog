It was a good week for Prototype lovers! Right along the [Prototype 1.6 security and performance release][1], <a href="http://thinkweb2.com/projects/prototype/" rel="contact">Kangax</a> (a very active community member) released an awesome, full-page, beautiful [Prototype cheatsheet][2] covering the very same release.

[![A preview of the Prototype cheatsheet](/page_attachments/0000/0005/prototype-cheatsheet.gif)][2]

In the bottom corner there is an incredibly useful diagram for those not yet familiar with dimensions/offsets API of elements and viewport. So, [download the Prototype cheatsheet][3], print it, hang it on your wall. I know I will.
