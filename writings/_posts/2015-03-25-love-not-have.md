We love a bird, so we pick her from the sky and put her in a cage. We love a fish, so we pull her out of the water and put her in a bowl. We love a human, so we grab her attention and seduce her away from others.

We don't let the bird escape for fear it might get eaten by a cat. We don't let the fish jump out of the bowl for fear it will suffocate. We don't let our human leave for fear she may not come back.

I propose: Leave the bird in the sky. You might catch glimpses of her in the trees. Leave the fish in the pond. You might spot ripples when she touches the surface. Leave the human on her own. She might come to you willingly. Some nights she will not.

Love a creature. They are all beautiful. But they shall never be yours.
