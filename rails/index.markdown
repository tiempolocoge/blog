As one of the [active contributors to Ruby on Rails][2], I gained thorough knowledge of the framework's capabilities. My experience covers the full stack and I'm comfortable working anywhere between low-level server-side optimization and working with the latest and greatest of client-side technologies.

Two interviews with me have been published in 2007:

1. [on Working With Rails][6] as one of the [June 2007 Hackfest winners][7];
2. [on RubyLearning][8] as part of a serial interview with programmers from around the world.
