As one of the [more active contributors to Rails framework][2], I gained a thorough knowledge of its possibilities. I write elegant markup using [Haml and Sass][3], test with [RSpec][4] and deploy with [Capistrano][5].

Two interviews with me have been published in 2007:

1. [on Working With Rails][6] as one of the [June 2007 Hackfest winners][7];
2. [on RubyLearning][8] as part of a big serial interview with many programmers from around the world.

If you appreciate what I do, [recommend me on Working With Rails][9] if you're a member there.
