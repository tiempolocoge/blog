It’s no secret that I love [git][1]. I switched this year and have been convincing other developers and giving talks about it (and version control in general) ever since. As much as developing Ruby without knowing and using Subversion was inconceivable, I believe that—after 2008—the same fact will apply to git.

I’ve also been hosting [my projects][2] (both public and private) on [GitHub][3]. Today I shared a new project called [“kickstart Rails”][4]. It’s a blank-slate Rails app that you can clone and start your new project off it, inspired by the [Caboose sample app][5].

Within **one hour** of pushing it to GitHub, one person already started watching it, sent me a comment over email and even _blogged_ about it! It was [Daniel Kehoe][6], and he was doing [a survey of Rails example applications][7].

I was amazed at this turnaround time. I thought it would take weeks until people spot my little project and maybe consider using it. GitHub exposes my projects so much better.
